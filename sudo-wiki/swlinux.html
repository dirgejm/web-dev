                    The Linux Kernel, conceived by Linus Torvalds in 1991 for his i386-based PC, stands as a testament to open-source innovation. Its creation was the begining of innovation in an operating system kernel that empowers users with control, flexibility, and customization options. Swiftly adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system, Linux gained momentum, becoming the foundation for an expanding spectrum of Linux distributions, commonly referred to as "distros".<sup id="1^"><a class="link" href="#1">[1]</a></sup><br><br>

                    At its core, the Linux Kernel is the architect of communication between hardware and software components, orchestrating tasks like memory management, I/O operations, and process coordination. It holds the reins to hardware resources and optimizes system performance, managing CPU usage, file systems, and network connections. Moreover, the kernel is among the foremost elements loaded during system startup, dictating the initiation and control of subsequent processes.<sup id="2^"><a class="link" href="#2">[2]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2 class="main-text-subheading-adj-table">Creation</h2>
                <p>
                    The inception of Linux traces back to 1991 when Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, developed the Linux kernel as a hobby project. Torvalds aimed to create a free and open-source alternative to proprietary operating systems, initially designing the kernel for personal use. However, by sharing his creation on Usenet, a community of developers began contributing to its development, forming the foundation of a collaborative movement. As the Linux community expanded, it embraced the principles of open-source software, allowing users to access, modify, and distribute the code freely. This ethos sparked the creation of numerous Linux distributions, each tailored to diverse user preferences and needs.<sup id="3^"><a class="link" href="#3">[3]</a></sup><br><br>
                    
                    Over time, Linux evolved into a versatile and powerful operating system, finding widespread adoption across a multitude of devices, from personal computers to servers, smartphones, and embedded systems. Today, Linux stands as a testament to the strength of collaborative development, embodying innovation, reliability, and adaptability in the ever-evolving landscape of technology. Its journey from a small personal project to a globally influential operating system highlights the enduring impact of community-driven innovation and the principles of openness in software development.<sup id="4^"><a class="link" href="#4">[4]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2 class="main-text-subheading">Distros</h2>
                <p>Linux distributions encompass a diverse array of operating systems built around the Linux kernel. Each distribution offers unique features, package management systems, and user interfaces tailored to various user needs and preferences. Countless distros are being released every day, however, there are a few that stand above the others. This comes down to a few reasons such as general reliability, the number of pre-installed applications (i.e. how streamlined they are), customizability, the purpose of the distro (e.g. Kali Linux for cybersecurity testing), ease of use (Ubuntu and Linux Mint are two popular distros known for ease of use), compatibility (e.g. Debian based distros being more generally compatible than rpm distros).
